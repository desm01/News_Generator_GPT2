Earlier in the day, Tory leader Michael Howard dismissed arguments over the polls saying they should be run \"firmly enough to establish they are independent\". A spokesman said the party was \"confident that the polls are well conducted and accurate\". He said the main problem could be that the polls were being run by two opposition parties. \"I think the problem is to do with some of the way we run elections. We have got to think hard about the best way to run our elections, and we will not be able to do that if we run the elections by two parties.

They say the polls need serious scrutiny, which is not being seen at the moment. However, they also say the polls, which were commissioned by the Tories, should be run with \"a sense of purpose\". It is believed the Tories will contest the general election in May with David Willetts at election chief, while the Liberal Democrats have made it their top priority to put up Tony Blair.

And he complained the new council tax plans targeted at councils were \"woefully inadequate\". \"Council tax rises in England have been going up 10 to 12 years as a percentage of council tax while council tax increases on council homes are still very low,\" Mr Davis told BBC One's Breakfast with Frost programme. \"I would say to this general assembly people, look you've got to build something new but it has to be a new solution that will actually work for these communities.\"\n","\n","Home Secretary Charles Clarke rejected opposition to plans to use local authorities to take on council landlords. He told MPs on Wednesday that there would be a minimum number of homes to be replaced for each adult and adult family destroyed, but warned a freeze on house building would lead to many problems. But Liberal Democrat David Heathcote said the strategy relied on \"a kind of political cat and mouse game of cat and mouse\" to see who could achieve the most destruction. He added that in terms of individual destruction, the strategy was more like \"a war of attrition\" than taking on the landlord of a council house. But Mr Heathcote criticised the way the national strategy for tackling the homelessness crisis was being planned and implemented.\n","\n","\"What we are going through on a national scale, we have never really seen before,\" Mr Heathcote said. \"This is a national crisis, it is not a regional one. We have seen housing pressures and a reduction in the number of homes that have been built. And the reality is that over time as people move from one area to another it is difficult to do in a systematic way so that you get the whole country.\" He accused ministers of creating a \"political football\" with plans such as a \"housing charity fund\" which would help local authorities replace all those they have destroyed. \"What we need is action, not simply talking about talks and promises and slogans like 'get people in, get everybody out' and all that stuff,\" Mr Heathcote said.\n","\n","<|endoftext|>\n","\n","<|startoftext|>\n","Tory leader defends attacks ad\n","\n","New Tory leader Michael Howard is appealing for voters' support during television debate on Wednesday night.\n","\n","He told BBC Radio 4's World at One: \"I'm giving the party a chance to show what they could do.\" The debate will be broadcast by the BBC News Channel and the PM will address the British public via the panellists.

He wants the government to admit that, yes, immigrants commit far more crime and generally do tend to commit far less nice things in return for lower taxes. But that is exactly what the asylum seekers wanted, a straight answer on immigration and legal status from the Tory leader. Mr Beith argued: \"It is not racist, as some spin on the right, to say that immigrants are inherently unsound.\" It is not racist, in the usual sense, to point out that those being deported must be entitled to legal protection against being persecuted in their country of origin (even if that protection is not absolute). Mr Beith's plan to stop asylum seekers from coming from \"countries where there is no prospect of a fair trial\" was another step in that direction.\n","\n","Tory leader Michael Howard has been pressing the issue of criminal asylum seekers, claiming that no one really wants to live in a country full of criminals.\n","\n","He claims to be addressing this with an EU country directive. This could start with a call for all asylum seekers to be fingerprinted and then all fingerprints would be sent to a central database so that police could search fingerprints in the national interest.\n","\n","Then there is the issue of identity cards, which the Tory leader has also pledged to stop. He thinks that the British public understands that you can't have sensible immigration policy if you have no idea how to handle immigration. He claims to be a strong supporter of the UK's asylum system but he wants fingerprinting of all asylum seekers, and a much clearer scheme to be implemented throughout the European Union to check asylum claims within 72 hours (if it is to be successful).\n","\n","While Mr Beith is speaking his critics will argue that if the UK doesn't want to take its fair share of the world's criminals then they should just go home (and not bother returning).\n","\n","Meanwhile the prime minister will be keeping a keen interest to his comments and his tone should lend itself perfectly to his plans to ban all asylum seekers, no matter how wealthy, if they decide to breach the rules of asylum. It remains to be seen whether the Tory plans will succeed in getting their heads around this. Will politicians like Mr Beith (and Mr Howard) simply let the asylum seekers go? Will the Tory plan be rejected by the nation's capital, and be dumped into the sea as it were?

The plan gives richer countries as well as the UK greater say over how the money is spent and what benefits they get.

The outgoing day care executive told his 1.22m followers it was not his fault and the assembly was not \"up to scratch\". He also paid tribute to the assembly's Italian-American co-chairman Tony Avella and said former premier Silvio Berlusconi would \"remain an icon of modernism and renewal\". The former prime minister's anger at the lack of action in the city can be summed up in three words: \"NOTHING.\" Nothing. Not even a hint of a trace of humour. Nothing could obscure the fact that, had Mr Berlusconi not switched to the more populist Letta, he would undoubtedly be mending relations with Italy's second-largest ethnic group, Basque. To have achieved what he did after leaving the centre-left Democratic Party, he says, would have been \"irresponsible and wrong\".\n","\n","In an apparent reference to the police deployment on Friday night, he said: \"The police did a very good job (at the scene). They dispersed (the troublemakers). They showed dignity and respect to the people who had been there standing guard. \"I think what really shook the building (of the 10 Downing Street rule) is the way the prime minister behaved. He is a paragon of virtue and we want to see more of that.\" The former premier says the image of him and his wife Olga, in the film Milk, struck a chord with the nation.

I think that the Tories are in for a big round of applause at the polls, don't you?\n","\n","Mr Berlusconi told his followers there was little hope of a breakthrough in the coming months, warning that the only way to win power was through the back door. His message to his supporters - and there are some here who believe he is still on the verge of some decisive act - was: \"NOTHING.\" Nothing. Not a peep. Not a wrinkle. Nothing to say. Because he believes the electorate will simply take that endorsement and run with it. \"If you want real change (through the back door) then get into the Labour camp and start talking,\" he said. \"Start talking about the things you care about - such as the NHS, the environment, the principles - and see what sticks. \"You don't win an election by squabbling with the doctors; you win them by listening to the voters.\"\n","\n","Followers of Berlusconi can look forward to plenty of eyebrow-raising in the coming months - will he still be around when the great recession hits? His new book claims he rejected a golden chalice as a teenager, instead opting for a glass of scotch. And will he still be able to command headlines for his hardline stance on immigration and asylum over the next few election campaigns? \"No one talks about Berlusconi the man - that is not what he is about,\" his friend Giuseppe Cossolini said. \"He is about attacking, both his Tory and Labour opponents. \"If you want to know what really matters in a political candidate, what really distinguishes Berlusconi, what truly distinguishes him from everything else in the race, tell him that.\"\n","\n","<|endoftext|>\n","\n","<|startoftext|>\n","Kennedy criticises 'warmonger' Blair\n","\n","Veteran politician and former UN secretary General Kofi Annan has criticised Britain's new political leaders Tony Blair and Charles Kennedy for their \"lack of vision\".\n","\n","Sir John Simpson, who led the UK delegation during the 1990s' cold war, said the policies of the two men were very much in keeping with the European Union's new liberal approach.

That is a jump of 11% since the YouGov poll a year ago and 12% compared with just four months ago. The poll also found the Tories beginning to crack down hard on Labour supporters who have set up shop in marginal seats - particularly in the South East.

Thomas Jefferson once said that \"the tolerance which is the legacy of Christian America has never been more precious\". The tolerance which is the legacy of George Washington has not been unlimited. It has been forced by force into a new form that is intolerant of dissent and people of different faiths and opinions.

Home Secretary Charles Clarke told MPs: \"In my day job I was at the International Finance Corporation working on behalf of the British taxpayer. \"I was struck by the level of detail and the speed of change that has taken place in the last five years. \"I see a marked improvement in the standards of living for the benefit of the people of Bangladesh, of people coming from Bangladesh coming to the UK.\"\n","\n","Mr Forsyth said that in his day job he had always had a keen interest in human rights, and had worked in a number of high profile jobs in Southeast Asia. \"I have a real appreciation now of the importance of human rights and the need to ensure that those people coming to the UK have the opportunity to live and work in the UK.\" He said he was \"quite shocked\" at the scale of the problem, saying it was \"very widespread\". \"In countries like Bangladesh there are huge inequalities in life expectancy, child mortality rates, educational standards. \"We know that there is a problem, but we don't know how widespread it is.\"\n","\n","<|endoftext|>\n","\n","<|startoftext|>\n","Borders rail link campaign rally\n","\n","Campaigners are to stage a rally calling for a Borders rail link which was closed in 1969 to be reopened.\n","\n","They will mark the 30th anniversary of the line closure, which ran from Edinburgh through the Borders and on to Carlisle, with a walk at Tweedbank. Anne Borthwick, of Campaign for Borders Rail, said re-opening the Waverley Line would restore the area's prosperity. MSPs are considering the reintroduction of passenger services to the Borders, which were suspended in 1969. The Borders has been a battleground between nationalists and the English Defence League (EDL). MSPs are also considering the reintroduction of passenger rail services to the southern tip of England. Campaigners are hoping to draw attention to the issue by staging a walk around the Borders in the summer.\n","\n","They have also launched a website, blightsonsblightsblaze.com, which they say can be accessed by typing \"Borders rail\" into the search box on the website of their choice. Ms Borthwick said reopening the Waverley Line would be \"irresponsible\" and \"highly unlikely\" given the disruption caused by the closure. She said re-routing the line would be \"the most disruptive action the government has ever taken\". Ms Borthwick said re-routing the line would be \"the most politically incorrect action the government has ever taken\". Ms Borthwick said the government had initially said the line would remain closed indefinitely, but had since admitted it was \"close to being closed permanently\". Ms Borthwick said the campaign was \"building on each other\" by collecting signatures to put the issue to a referendum.\n","\n","<|endoftext|>\n","\n","<|startoftext|>\n","Labour battle plan 'hides Blair'\n","\n","The Tories have accused Tony Blair of being \"terrified\" of scrutiny after failing to name names the \"most unpopular MP in the world\".\n","\n","In one of the most embarrassing defeats for Downing Street in recent memory, the prime minister was not at the dinner guest who had once employed him as a political assistant. Instead, he stayed at his post as Tory co-chairman. The Tories accuse Mr Blair of making a \"pathetic\" of effort to change public perception of the prime minister. In an interview ahead of the dinner, Mr Blair said he had received a \"huge amount of flak\" from colleagues about his personal integrity.\n","\n","\"There is a time when you are absolutely terrified of facing direct, unfavourable scrutiny,\" the prime minister told the BBC's Breakfast with Frost. He added that he had started thinking about replacing his own nameplate, which he had received a written apology for, and would be restoring the whip. The dinner guest, who once worked as a freelance newspaper baron, made a personal appearance to voice his concerns about the prime minister. He said: \"I used to work for Harold Wilson...now I work for Tony Blair. I mean he is quite possibly the most unpopular politician in the world.\"\n","\n","Mr Blair refused to say sorry for the insult of his new job\n","\n","[1510 | 3246.27] loss=0.20 avg=0.83\n","[1520 |
